          <h1>My Next Vacation: Disney World</h1>
          <p>Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of spending a few days getting lost in the happiest place on Earth.</p>

          <h2>Why Disney World?</h2>
          <p class="bg-info">While there are many reasons one might want to spend some time in Disney World. Here are three big reasons why <strong><em>I</em></strong> want to go so bad:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Thrill Rides</strong>
                <p>Disney is great for adults who love thrill rides. Although not as extreme as some amusement parks, for what Disney lacks in intensity it makes up for in added experience</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Timeless and Unique Rides</strong>
                <p>For adults who arenâ€™t really up for more fast paced attractions, there are many classic and unique rides to enjoy.</p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Disney Food</strong>
                <p>Even beyond choices in Epcot, The Walt Disney World Resort is an excellent option for foodies everywhere. With over 135 restaurants, Disney has not just the best theme park dining, but some of the most highly-rated dining around</p>

            </ol>
